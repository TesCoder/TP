        "James brings wide and deep experience to assist students applying to US universities. Some of his experiences specifically involve Stanford: he got his engineering degree there, taught three design courses, served as small group coach for two other courses, did undergraduate admissions, had one daughter admitted and another waitlisted. But James has integrated the knowledge gained at Stanford with his other experiences teaching at both public and private high schools in the US, Australia, and New Zealand as well as being a parent of high achieving students. James understands the process and strives to work with motivated students in creating compelling “profiles” to generate a range of great admission offers.",
